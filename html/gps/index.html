<!-- Semantic tags are used for accessibility and to make it easier to share code between developers
The browser uses the order the html is in unless css is added to it
I learned how to create snippets, more about how existing snippets work (the lorem ipsum snippet!!so useful!) I think I will definitely create snippets in the future once i can figure out where I need to save them
The most difficult part of the challenge was figuring out how to explain things that have an explanation in my head but that is difficult to give words to. Also it was difficult to come to a consensus on how to use semantic tags - I think this was especially true because developers can use semantic tags differently as long as they are consistent, so there aren't crystal clear definitions for things. I think I can prove my understanding of these concepts by just continuing to practice more and more and more! Practice makes perfect :) -->
