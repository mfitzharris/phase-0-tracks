##How to use an elevator
- find elevator
- When elevators are found, scan walls near to elevator doors for the up and down buttons.

  - if a light is lit up with your direction and the doors open, get in the elevator
  - otherwise, continue to wait.

  - assess the buttons, and find part with numbers
    - if the number matches the floor you want to go to press press the button with it on it
    - otherwise continue scanning the numbers
- Wait quietly as the elevator ascends or descends. When doors open
  - Is there a screen inside the elevator indicating a number?
    - If so does that number correspond to the floor you want to go to?
      - If so, walk out of the elevator. You successfully used an elevator!
      - Otherwise, let the doors close and continue to wait.
    - Otherwise, look for other signs with numbers outside of the elevator
      - If you see a sign with a number that corresponds to the floor you want to go to, walk out of the elevator. You successfully used an elevator!
      - Otherwise, let the doors close and continue to wait.
