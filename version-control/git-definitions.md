# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* *What is version control?  Why is it useful?*
  Version control is a method of saving your code that allows you to still see your earlier code, be able to revert back to older code, and track and make comments on each updated version

* *What is a branch and why would you use one?*
  A branch is a way of copying your work/project from the master branch. It is used to keep the master branch as perfect as possible and gives you an opportunity to work out bugs without affected the master branch before merging back. It is also used to take the work in different directions.

* *What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?*
  A commit is a method of recording your changes and basically saving a version of our project. A good commit message should describe the changes that have been made in that version.

* *What is a merge conflict?*
  It is an error that arises when the two branches that are attempting to be merged have edited the same part of the project (or file in the project) differently or if one of the branches has removed files/folders/etc and the other has not. Git recognizes these differences and then pauses the merge.
